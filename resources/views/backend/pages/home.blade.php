  Home Dashboard Content page here...

  I've never told a lie <br>
  And that makes me a liar <br>
  I've never made a bet, but we gamble with desire <br>
  I've never lit a match with intent to start a fire <br>
  But recently the flames are getting out of control <br>
  <br><br>
  Call me a name <br>
  Kill me with words <br>
  Forget about me <br>
  It's what I deserve <br>
  I was your chance <br>
  To get out of this town <br>
  But I ditched the car and left you to <br>
